# cifar10_classification
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 different classes: airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. The goal is to build an accurate model that can predict the class of an input image from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

# CIFAR-10 Image Classification Using CNNs

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 different classes: airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.

## Problem Statement

CIFAR-10 is a dataset that consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The goal is to classify these images into their respective categories using a deep learning model.

## Data Source

The dataset can be downloaded from the [CIFAR-10 page](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

## Steps

1. **Import Libraries/Datasets**
2. **Visualize Data**
3. **Data Preparation**
4. **Train the Model**
5. **Evaluate the Model**

## Requirements

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- keras
- tensorflow

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
2.pip install -r requirements.txt
3.python cifar10_classification.py
