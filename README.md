# cifar10_classification
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 different classes: airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. The goal is to build an accurate model that can predict the class of an input image from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
